# fuzzblob.github.io

This used to be the source for my website at http://tammik.ca which now is replaced with a wordpress blog / site.
You can see the code in the repository running live here: http://fuzzblob.github.io.

It is built with using a simplistic design in HTML and CSS (and some of the formatting is not so nice imho)

Love,

Maris
